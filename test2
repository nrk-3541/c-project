THIS IS TO CHECK WETHER THE WEBHOOK IS TRIGGERING OR NOT
this is to check wether the github scm poll is working
github trigger isnt woking
github poll scm tirgger shouuld work when it is enabled and configured in the jenkins job
this is to check the github polling by scm change.
if webhook is enabled to the job then automatically the job will get triggered
by webhooks only we can trigger the job by pusing the changes to github
okay now check the webhook is acitve or not
